                <h1>What is Food Waste?</h1>
                <br>
                <span>
                    In line with the United States <span class="yellowraleway">Environmental Protection Agency
                        (EPA)</span> and the United Nations’
                    definition, <span class="curs"><span>R</span>escue<span>K</span>itchen</span> now defines <span
                        class="yellowraleway">“food
                        waste”</span> as uneaten food and inedible parts (e.g., peels, pits,
                    bones) going to the following eight destinations: <span class="greenraleway">composting</span>,
                    <span class="greenraleway">anaerobic digestion</span>, <span class="greenraleway">landfill</span>,
                    <span class="greenraleway">combustion</span>, <span class="greenraleway">sewer</span>, <span
                        class="greenraleway">dumping</span>, <span class="greenraleway">spread onto land</span>, or
                    <span class="greenraleway">not harvested</span>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It’s a subset of <span class="yellowraleway">“surplus food”</span> –
                        which <span class="curs"><span>R</span>escue<span>K</span>itchen</span> defines as all food that
                        goes unsold or unused by a business or that goes uneaten at
                        home – including food and inedible parts that are donated, fed to animals, repurposed to produce
                        other products, and all of the destinations represented in food waste. Some surplus food is
                        inevitable, but the goal of food waste reduction efforts is not only to get food out of
                        landfills.
                        It’s also to make sure food is going to its <span class="yellowraleway">“highest and best
                            use”</span> – that is, being eaten by
                        people.
                        This can be seen in guidance provided by the <span class="yellowraleway">EPA</span> in its
                        Wasted Food Scale.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Essentially, all of the
                        resources required to produce, transport, store, and sell a truckload of strawberries have been
                        better used when those strawberries are consumed by people rather than, for example, added to
                        soil
                        as compost – or worse, sent to landfill. The U.S. Government has set a <span
                            class="greenraleway">50% food waste reduction goal</span>
                        that aims to cut the amount of food waste in the retail, food service, and residential sectors
                        in
                        half, in line with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12.3.
